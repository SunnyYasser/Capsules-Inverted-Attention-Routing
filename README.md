## Overview

### Overall Architecture
<p align="center">
<img src='imgs/overall.png' width="1000px"/>

An example of our proposed architecture is shown above. The backbone is a standard feed-forward convolutional neural network. The features extracted from this network are fed through another convolutional layer. At each spatial location, groups of 16 channels are made to create capsules (we assume a 16-dimensional pose in a capsule). LayerNorm is then applied across the 16 channels to obtain the primary capsules. This is followed by two convolutional capsule layers, and then by two fully-connected capsule layers. In the last capsule layer, each capsule corresponds to a class. These capsules are then used to compute logits that feed into a softmax to computed the classification probabilities. Inference in this network requires a feed-forward pass up to the primary capsules. After this, our proposed routing mechanism (discussed later) takes over.

### Inverted Dot-Product Attention Routing
<p align="center">
<img src='imgs/inverted_attention.png' width="1000px"/>

In our method, the routing procedure resembles an inverted attention mechanism, where dot products are used to measure agreement. Specifically, the higher-level (parent) units compete for the attention of the lower-level (child) units, instead of the other way around, which is commonly used in attention models. Hence, the routing probability directly depends on the agreement between the parent’s pose (from the previous iteration step) and the child’s vote for the parent’s pose (in the current iteration step). We (1) use Layer Normalization (Ba et al., 2016) as normalization, and we (2) perform inference of the latent capsule states and routing probabilities jointly across multiple capsule layers (instead of doing it layer-wise). 

### Concurrent Routing

The concurrent routing is a parallel-in-time routing procedure for all capsules layers.
